==Early uses==
''Hello'', with that spelling, was used in publications in the U.S. as early as the 18 October 1826 edition of the ''[[Norwich Courier]]'' of [[Norwich, Connecticut]].<ref name="oed-hello"/> Another early use was an 1833 American book called ''The Sketches and Eccentricities of Col. David Crockett, of West Tennessee'',<ref>(Anonymous).

==Etymology==
According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''hello'' is an alteration of ''hallo'', ''hollo'',<ref name="oed-hello"/> which came from [[Old High German]] "''halâ'', ''holâ'', emphatic imperative of ''halôn'', ''holôn'' to fetch, used especially in hailing a ferryman".<ref>{{cite OED|term=hallo|id=83588}}</ref> It also connects the development of ''hello'' to the influence of an earlier form, ''holla'', whose origin is in the French ''holà'' (roughly, 'whoa there!', from French ''là'' 'there').<ref>{{cite OED|term=holla|id=87735}}</ref> As in addition to ''hello'', ''halloo'',<ref>Butler, Mann, ''[https://archive.org/details/historyofcommonw00butl A History of the Commonwealth of Kentucky]'', Wilcox, Dickerman & Co., 1834, p. 106.</ref> ''hallo'', ''hollo'', ''hullo'' and (rarely) ''hillo'' also exist as variants or related words, the word can be spelt using any of all five vowels.<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hollo Merriam-Webster: Hollo]</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hullo Merriam-Webster: Hullo]</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hillo Merriam-Webster: Hillo]</ref>

===Telephone===
The use of ''hello'' as a [[telephone]] greeting has been credited to [[Thomas Edison]]; according to one source, he expressed his surprise with a misheard ''Hullo''.<ref name=koenigsberg >{{cite magazine|url=http://www.collectorcafe.com/article_archive.asp?article=800&id=1507 |title=The First "Hello!": Thomas Edison, the Phonograph and the Telephone – Part 2 |author=Allen Koenigsberg |magazine=Antique Phonograph Magazine |volume=VIII |issue=6 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116211033/http://www.collectorcafe.com/article_archive.asp?article=800&id=1507 |archive-date=16 November 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Alexander Graham Bell]] initially used ''[[Ahoy (greeting)|Ahoy]]'' (as used on ships) as a telephone greeting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.cs.uh.edu/~klong/papers/hello.txt|title=All Things Considered|author=Allen Koenigsberg|publisher=National Public Radio|access-date=2006-09-13|year=1999|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309094200/http://www2.cs.uh.edu/~klong/papers/hello.txt|archive-date=2009-03-09}}</ref><ref name=etymology>{{Cite web |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=hello&searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |work=etymonline.com
 |access-date=28 September 2010}}</ref> However, in 1877, Edison wrote to T. B. A. David, president of the Central District and Printing Telegraph Company of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]:

{{quote|Friend David, I do not think we shall need a call bell as Hello! can be heard 10 to 20 feet away.
What you think? Edison - P.S. first cost of sender & receiver to manufacture is only $7.00.<ref name=koenigsberg />}}

By 1889, central telephone exchange operators were known as 'hello-girls' because of the association between the greeting and the telephone.<ref name=etymology/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/05/garden/great-hello-mystery-is-solved.html|title=Great 'Hello' Mystery Is Solved|last=Grimes|first=William|date=5 March 1992|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-25|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

===Hullo===
''Hello'' might be derived from an older spelling variant, ''hullo'', which the American [[Merriam-Webster]] dictionary describes as a "chiefly British variant of hello",<ref name="MW">{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hullo |title=hullo - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=25 April 2007 |access-date=2009-09-26}}</ref> and which was originally used as an exclamation to call attention, an expression of surprise, or a greeting. ''Hullo'' is found in publications as early as 1803.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=27sCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA12&dq=hullo&lr=&as_drrb_is=b&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=1760&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=1804&num=100&as_brr=0&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html ''The Sporting Magazine.''] London (1803).

===Hallo and hollo===
{{Redirect|Hallo}}
''Hello'' is alternatively thought to come from the word ''hallo'' (1840) via ''hollo'' (also ''holla'', ''holloa'', ''halloo'', ''halloa'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/hello|title=Hello|publisher=Merriam-Webster Online|access-date=2016-02-07}}</ref> The definition of ''hollo'' is to shout or an exclamation originally shouted in a [[fox hunt|hunt]] when the quarry was spotted:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/hollo|title=Hollo|publisher=Merriam-Webster Online|access-date=2016-02-07}}</ref>  
{{quote|If I fly, Marcius,/Halloo me like a hare.|''[[Coriolanus (play)|Coriolanus]]'' (I.viii.7), [[William Shakespeare]]}}

[[Fowler's]] has it that "hallo" is first recorded "as a shout to call attention" in 1864.<ref>''The New Fowler's'', revised third edition by R. W. Burchfield, [[Oxford University Press]].  {{ISBN|0-19-860263-4}}, p. 356.</ref>
It is used by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s famous poem ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'' written in 1798:
{{quote|
And the good south wind still blew behind,<br />
But no sweet bird did follow,<br /> 
Nor any day for food or play <br />
Came to the mariners' hollo!}}

In many [[Germanic languages]], including [[German language|German]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], "''hallo''" literally translates into English as "hello". In the case of Dutch, it was used as early as 1797 in a letter from [[Willem Bilderdijk]] to his sister-in-law as a remark of astonishment.<ref>Bilderdijk, Willem  [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/bild002lief01_01/bild002lief01_01_0107.php?q=hallo ''Liefde en ballingschap. Brieven 1795-1797''] (ed. Marita Mathijsen). Uitgeverij De Arbeiderspers, Amsterdam/Antwerp 1997</ref> 

[[Webster's dictionary]] from 1913 traces the etymology of ''holloa'' to the Old English ''halow'' and suggests: "Perhaps from ah + lo; compare Anglo Saxon ealā".

According to the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'', ''hallo'' is a modification of the obsolete ''holla'' (''stop!''), perhaps from Old French ''hola'' (''ho'', ho! + ''la'', there, from Latin ''illac'', that way).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartelby.com/61/60/H0136000.html|title=Hello|publisher= The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition.|year=2000|access-date=2006-09-01}}</ref>

The Old English verb, hǽlan (1. wv/t1b 1 to heal, cure, save; greet, salute; gehǽl! Hosanna!), may be the ultimate origin of the word.<ref>[http://home.comcast.net/~modean52/oeme_dictionaries.htm OEME Dictionaries]</ref> Hǽlan is likely a cognate of German Heil (meaning ''complete'' for things and ''healthy'' for beings) and other similar words of Germanic origin.  [[Bill Bryson]] asserts in his book ''Mother Tongue'' that "hello" comes from Old English ''hál béo þu'' ("Hale be thou", or "whole be thou", meaning a wish for good health; [[cf.]] "goodbye" which is a contraction of "God be with ye").

=="Hello, World" computer program==
{{Main|"Hello, World!" program}}
Students learning a new computer programming language will often begin by writing a "Hello, World!" program, which does nothing but issue the message "Hello, world" to the user (such as by displaying it on a screen). It has been used since the earliest programs, in many computer languages. This tradition was further popularised after being printed in an introductory chapter of the book ''[[The C Programming Language]]'' by Kernighan & Ritchie.<ref>{{cite book | last = Kernighan | first = Brian W. | author-link = Brian W.
